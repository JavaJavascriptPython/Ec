This is a classic issue related to the **Shellshock vulnerability** (CVE-2014-6271) and how different Apache/CGI configurations handle malicious input patterns.

The pattern `(){` you're testing is specifically problematic because it resembles the Shellshock attack vector that exploits bash shell vulnerabilities. Here's what's likely happening:

## Root Cause Analysis

**Server 1 (Working):** 
- Properly sanitizes input before passing to shell
- Has updated bash/security patches
- May have additional input validation/filtering

**Server 2 (Failing):**
- Input containing `(){` is being passed unsanitized to the shell
- This triggers either a security protection mechanism or an actual shell vulnerability
- The "site can't be reached" error suggests the process is crashing or being killed

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check your Perl CGI code** - Look for how search parameters are processed:
```perl
# Problematic pattern:
system("grep '$search_term' files.txt");

# Better approach:
$search_term =~ s/[^\w\s]//g;  # Remove special chars
```

2. **Compare Apache configurations** between servers:
```bash
# Check Apache version
httpd -v

# Check CGI module configuration
grep -i cgi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

3. **Check bash versions** on both servers:
```bash
bash --version
```

4. **Review Apache error logs**:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/httpd/error_log
```

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Input Sanitization** in your Perl script:
```perl
# Sanitize search input
$search_term =~ s/[(){}\[\]|&;<>]//g;
# Or use a whitelist approach
$search_term =~ s/[^\w\s\-.]//g;
```

2. **Use safer system calls**:
```perl
# Instead of system() with user input
# Use Perl's built-in functions or properly escape
use String::ShellQuote;
my $safe_term = shell_quote($search_term);
```

3. **Update the vulnerable server**:
```bash
# Update bash and Apache
yum update bash httpd  # RHEL/CentOS
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade bash apache2  # Debian/Ubuntu
```

The immediate fix is to add proper input validation to your Perl CGI script to filter out dangerous characters before any shell operations.
